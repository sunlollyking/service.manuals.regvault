"""A small client for the REG-Vault catalogue.

Only one call is needed: look a game up by system and ROM hash. Kodi copies
the manual itself, from the URL handed back to it, so nothing is downloaded
here.

The service publishes a free tier of 1,000 metadata requests a day per address
and asks that it not be scraped in bulk, so requests are paced and a rate
limit response stops the run rather than being retried around.

No Kodi imports here, so it can be tested on its own.
