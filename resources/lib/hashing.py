"""Produces the ROM hash the catalogue is keyed by.

REG-Vault keys games on an MD5 of the ROM file itself. That makes a match
exact: either the file is the dump the catalogue knows, or it is not, and
there is no chance of being handed a different game's manual.

The cost is that the hash is per dump. A different region, revision or hack
hashes differently and simply will not be found, which is a miss rather than
a wrong answer.

No Kodi imports here, so it can be tested on its own.
