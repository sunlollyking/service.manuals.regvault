"""Answers Kodi's find-a-manual dialog from the REG-Vault catalogue.

Kodi calls this the way it calls a subtitle service - as a plugin, with a
directory listing for an answer:

  plugin://service.manuals.regvault/?action=search&path=<game>&title=<name>

The dialog hands over the game's path and leaves the matching to us, so the
ROM is hashed here rather than in Kodi. Each result's path is the manual
itself, which Kodi copies to wherever it wants it.

Everything that can be reasoned about without Kodi lives in resources/lib and
is tested on its own. This file is only the part that has to talk to Kodi.
